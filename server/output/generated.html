Goal
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to build a Full-stack web application
called “Email Builder” that can create email templates.
What are Email Templates? And what is an Email Builder?
Fig 1. Examples of Email Templates
Email Templates are used by companies to engage with their customers often for Marketing
use. And Email Builder is a web app that can be used to build such templates easily by nontechnical users.
Email templates have primarily two components
1. A Base Layout (Often HTML file) that defines structure of the template
2. Email Object (variables) that store fields such as Title, content, footer, imageUrls etc.
Once you have understood what an email template is, you will need to create a simple email
template layout.html file that you will store in your server (or backend) and will be used for
next steps.
Step 1: Build the Frontend
Screenshot below is an example of how an email builder frontend looks like.
Fig 2. Example UI of an Email Builder.
NOTE: This is an example screenshot from a full featured app ONLY for your reference. You
don’t necessarily have to build all the same features.
You can use any modern Frontend framework like React / Vue / Angular to create the
frontend.
Frontend should have following features at minimum
1. Ability to get the HTML content of layout from backend and display it in editor.
2. Ability to edit text fields such Title, Content,
3. Ability to upload an image
4. Store the values of all fields in a JS object that can be then sent to the backend.
Advanced features for Bonus points (Not mandatory)
1. Ability to move sections up and down on the template.
2. Ability to edit colors, text size, alignment etc. for text fields.
Step 2: Build API & Backend
Using any backend technology and framework of your choice. You might need
following APIs. You can create more if necessary.
1. /getEmailLayout: Gets the HTML code of layout.html file stored on your
server to frontend.
2. /uploadImage: Create an API to upload Image Assets
3. /uploadEmailConfig: Stores the EmailTemplate JSON object in database.
4. /renderAndDownloadTemplate: Use the layout html and substitute the
values configured from frontend to generate an output HTML file.
Step 3: Hosting & Deployment
Use any deployment / hosting service of your choice to publish your app and get a publicly
accessible URL.
Deliverable:
1. Publicly accessible URL of your working webapp. Submissions without a working URL
of the app will not be evaluated.
2. Public Github Repository of your application.
Evaluation criteria:
1. Visual Aesthetics, Functionality and Features completed for Email Builder
2. Simplicity, Clarity and Ease of Use. Responsiveness of Email Template on different
Email clients such as Gmail, Outlook etc.
NOTE: Because of large number of applications, it is not possible to for us to reply to all
questions from candidates. Take your best assumption in case of doubts. Evaluation is
based on how well you understand the problem and your efforts.
